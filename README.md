2. **Via Settings Screen** (within the app): Go to Settings and enter your API key

## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:
- **Camera**: To take photos of meals
- **Storage/Media**: To access images from gallery
- **Internet**: To communicate with Gemini API

## Building from Source

1. Make sure you have the latest Android SDK tools installed
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Sync Gradle dependencies
4. Build the APK: `Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)`
5. Install the APK on your device or run directly from Android Studio

## Troubleshooting

### "API key not found" Error
- Make sure you've added `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `local.properties` or entered it in Settings
- Verify the API key is correct and has proper permissions

### Camera Not Working
- Check that camera permission is granted in device settings
- Make sure your device has a camera

### Images Not Loading
